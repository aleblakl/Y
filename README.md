# Y

# Y is a mobile phone app I am creating which will allow users to convert images into NFTs and display them in a public online gallery.

# With Y anyone who owns a smart phone can download the app and create an account. This app is like a social media app, but it's also a marketplace. So, users can share images, comment on photos, explore and interact with anyone across the country, and also buy and sell each others pictures. Pictures could be sold for as little as 50 cents, or any amount. I'm not sure how it might evolve. The main idea is that you can take any image you want and create an NFT of that image almost instantly.

Frontend Interface: You'll need a user-friendly interface, like a web or mobile app, where users can upload their pictures. This interface can be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Image Upload: Users upload their pictures through the frontend interface. The image data is usually stored off-chain in a centralized server or a decentralized storage solution (like IPFS).

Smart Contract: The smart contract will be deployed on a blockchain that supports NFTs, such as Ethereum. You can write the smart contract using Solidity. Here's a high-level overview of how the contract might look:
